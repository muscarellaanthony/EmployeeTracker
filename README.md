# Employee Tracker

## Description
This is a database editor that uses command line prompts to keep track of employees, departments and job roles within a buisiness. This is my first project that uses sql to creat and edit a database. 

## Installation
After opening the application in a code editor, be sure to run 'npm i' in the command line to install all dependecies required for the application to behave correctly. You will then need to open postgres and run the schema and seed file to create the database.

## Usage
With all dependencies installed, and an initilaized database, run 'node index.js' in the command line to begin the prompts and choose your desired method.
